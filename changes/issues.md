Another problem is that for each job position it says "56% match" and the match analysis is the same for each job listing  and it goes like this: "⚠️ Moderate skill match. You have 2 out of 5 required skills. 📋 Job Requirements: programming, algorithms, data structures, strong programming skills, passion for technology 🎯 Your matching skills: algorithms, data structures 📊 Metadata Analysis: ✅ Experience level matches well ℹ️ Location compatibility unclear ✅ Industry preference matches ⚠️ Citizenship/visa requirements may be challenging 🎯 Final Score: 56/100 (Skills: 45/100, Metadata: 80/100)" we need to make this more personalized for each job posting.
