YOUR TASK - ANALYZE AND SCORE (0-100):

1. **RESUME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS (40% weight - MOST IMPORTANT)**:
   - Evaluate resume sophistication and depth
   - Consider: project complexity, work experience quality, technical depth, problem-solving demonstrated
   - Indicators of ADVANCED resume:
     * Multiple substantial projects with technical details
     * Work experience at known companies
     * Leadership roles, mentoring, or teaching experience
     * Research papers, publications, or open source contributions
     * Advanced coursework or specializations
     * Awards, competitions, or recognition
     * Deep technical implementations (not just "used React")
   - Indicators of BEGINNER resume:
     * Minimal work experience or only academic projects
     * Basic coursework projects
     * Surface-level skill mentions
     * No demonstrated depth in any technology
     * Limited context or details
   
   Rate complexity: ADVANCED (80-100), INTERMEDIATE (50-79), BEGINNER (0-49)

2. **EXPERIENCE LEVEL MATCHING (30% weight)**:
   - Is this job appropriate for the candidate's level?
   - CRITICAL: If job requires "senior", "lead", "5+ years", "10+ years", "architect", "principal", "manager"
     AND candidate is BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE ‚Üí Score = 0 (immediate disqualification)
   - Match entry-level candidates with entry-level/intern roles
   - Match advanced candidates with appropriate challenging roles

3. **SKILL ALIGNMENT (20% weight)**:
   - How many required skills does the candidate actually possess?
   - Quality of skill match (demonstrated experience vs just mentioned)
   - Require minimum 2 matching skills or score = 0

4. **CAREER FIT (10% weight)**:
   - Does this job align with the candidate's trajectory?
   - Would this be a good next step for their career?

SCORING RULES:
- Return 0 if:
  * Job requires senior/experienced level and candidate is beginner
  * Job requires 5+ years and resume shows < 2 years
  * Less than 2 matching skills
  * Job is clearly misaligned with candidate level
- Return 1-40 for poor matches (not recommended)
- Return 41-70 for acceptable matches (reasonable fit)
- Return 71-100 for excellent matches (strong recommendation)

**HEAVY EMPHASIS**: Resume complexity should be the PRIMARY factor. An advanced candidate with a sophisticated resume should NOT match entry-level positions, and a beginner should NOT match senior roles.

JOBS TO ANALYZE ({len(filtered_jobs)} positions):
{json.dumps(jobs_summary, indent=2)}

YOUR TASK - COMPREHENSIVE BATCH ANALYSIS:

For EACH job, provide detailed analysis using this WEIGHTED SCORING SYSTEM:

üèÜ SCORING WEIGHTS (Total = 100 points):

1. **PROJECT DEPTH & REAL-WORLD IMPACT (35% - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
   Look for evidence of:
   - ‚úÖ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS: "deployed to production", "live users", "in production"
   - ‚úÖ REAL USER IMPACT: Actual user counts, engagement metrics, downloads, usage stats
   - ‚úÖ TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: System design, scalability, architecture, performance optimization
   - ‚úÖ PROBLEM-SOLVING DEPTH: Specific technical challenges solved (not just "built a website")
   - ‚úÖ PROJECT SCALE: Team size, codebase size, duration, iterations
   - ‚úÖ TANGIBLE RESULTS: Revenue generated, users acquired, performance improvements (e.g., "reduced load time by 40%")
   
   üö´ IGNORE KEYWORD RESUMES: If resume just lists technologies without depth ("Built app using React, Node.js") = LOW SCORE
   ‚≠ê REWARD DEPTH: "Deployed React app to AWS with 500+ daily users, implemented Redis caching reducing API latency by 60%" = HIGH SCORE

2. **WORK EXPERIENCE QUALITY (25%)**
   - Real internships/jobs at actual companies >> Academic projects
   - Startup/company experience >> Side projects >> Coursework
   - Leadership roles, mentoring, team collaboration
   - Open source contributions, published work
   - Research with publications or citations

3. **SKILL ALIGNMENT WITH JOB (20%)**
   - How many DEMONSTRATED skills (not just mentioned) match the role?
   - Quality over quantity: Deep expertise in 2-3 technologies > Surface knowledge of 10
   - Consider technology stack alignment (e.g., React experience for React role)

4. **EXPERIENCE LEVEL APPROPRIATENESS (15%)**
   - Is this role suitable for candidate's level?
   - CRITICAL: Senior roles for juniors = 0 score
   - Entry-level roles for advanced candidates = lower score (they'd be bored)

5. **CAREER TRAJECTORY & GROWTH POTENTIAL (5%)**
   - Does this role advance their career?
   - Learning opportunities in the role
   - Company reputation and mentorship

üìä SCORING EXAMPLES:

HIGH SCORE (80-95):
- "Deployed full-stack e-commerce platform with 1000+ users, integrated Stripe payments, built CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions" ‚Üí 85
- "Interned at Microsoft on Azure team, shipped feature used by 10K+ developers, reduced deployment time by 50%" ‚Üí 92

MEDIUM SCORE (50-70):
- "Built multiple React projects including todo app and weather app with API integration" ‚Üí 55
- "Completed 3 academic projects: database system, mobile app, web scraper" ‚Üí 60

LOW SCORE (20-40):
- "Familiar with React, Node.js, Python, Java, AWS, Docker..." (just keywords, no depth) ‚Üí 25
- "Course projects using various technologies" (no specifics) ‚Üí 30

2. **REASONING** (2-3 sentences): Be SPECIFIC about:
   - What production/real-world experience stands out?
   - Which demonstrated skills (with depth) match this role?
   - Why this score vs higher/lower?

3. **RED_FLAGS**: Note if:
   - Resume is all keywords with no substance
   - Experience level mismatch
   - No evidence of actual deployments or real work

4. **SKILL_MATCHES**: Only list skills with DEMONSTRATED depth (not just mentioned)
5. **SKILL_GAPS**: Important skills for the role they don't show evidence of

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO two jobs should have identical scores (vary based on specifics)
- HEAVILY PENALIZE keyword-only resumes without depth
- HEAVILY REWARD production deployments and real-world impact
- Value 1 production project > 10 tutorial projects
- Look for metrics, users, performance improvements, business impact
- Consider: "Would I hire this person based on proven results, not buzzwords?"
